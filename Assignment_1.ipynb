    "1. Why are dictionary keys required to be immutable in Python? Explain\n",

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    " Python employs hashing to efficiently store and retrieve key-value pairs, so dictionary keys must be immutable. \n",
    " The hash value of a key is determined when it is added to a dictionary.\n",
    " Python wouldn't be able to find the key accurately if it were mutable and changed later because its hash value would likewise change.\n",
    " As a result, consistency, dependability, and quick dictionary lookups are guaranteed by immutability.\n"
